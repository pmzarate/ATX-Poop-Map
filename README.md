# ATX-Poop-Map
1st stab of final project.  A take of the infamous "SnapCrap" app from SFO, but for ATX.  User can log in and report incidents of human poop left in ATX public areas. Once location is geolocated, the map will mark a poop icon, which will include date/time and any additional comments User would like to leave.   Users will also be able to report any leftover poop from our precious pooches!  There is a field for rating public restrooms and dog parks noting location/date/time, as well as any additional comments.
